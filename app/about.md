I'm Lucas Cajal, a data engineer working at Zurich Insurance. I have worked mainly as an ETL developer using Spark, both with Scala and Python, and also done some backend
development. I have professional experience both in AWS and Azure (I've only played with GCP for personal never-finished
projects), and have a semi-strong foundation of the concepts of containers, having used mainly Docker and more recently
Docker compose. My current goal is to learn and master Kubernetes.
